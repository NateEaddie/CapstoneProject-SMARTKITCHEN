# Project Description:
# To manage kitchen environments (both teaching and industry) using computer technology that would increase accessibility and decrease potential risk of harm for individuals. Our wants would be to create technology that allows for our SMART (human centered design) kitchen to be managed from a CresCor system or a computer application that can be managed from a tablet or phone. This allows educators to manage the kitchen or culinary classroom environment remotely in order to increase access and efficiencies. This redirect/process change also allows for student with both hidden and non-hidden barriers to participate at greater levels. In addition, this will allow a reduction in steps/maneuvers within the space that decreases the potential for harm or injury.
